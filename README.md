An innovative electronic fire detection system uses the Internet
Internet (HTTP) to signal the presence to a remote assistance centre
of a fire. In particular, the system is distributed between the place where the
probe is installed and the control center. At the place of installation, we find
the probe and the process that is constantly listening to it to pick up the
fire signal. In the control center, we find the components instead
who carry out the operations necessary to alert the competent personnel of the
danger. The information that must be available to personnel
responsible must be the geographical coordinates (latitude and
longitude) of the probe and the amount of smoke perceived by the probe. Because the
system is still being tested, we want to give you the ability to change
in the future the communication channel between the probe and the control center. 
Implement the model associated with the described application making use of design patterns where possible. 
It is not necessary to implement the details for the effective invocation of the url, 
it is sufficient to print the complete path of the requested data in the logs.
